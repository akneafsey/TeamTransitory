IDEAS


	
Forecast inflation without pandemic and compare to pandemic figures		
    Can split up into regions
		
Can build narrative on how pandemic accelerated certain price increases (e.g. Expected price of XYZ to reach the levels it did in 2021/22 in 2025 etc) 

Possible covariance matrix on prices of goods
	
If we see GBP currency moves effecting inflation
	
Is the BoE behind the curve more than usual this time? Can look at base rates along with CPI figures over time
